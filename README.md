# Description

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple, yet entertaining Java Swing-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. This game allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid, with the objective of achieving a winning combination of their respective symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. If no player achieves a winning combination and all cells are filled, the game ends in a tie.

The game provides a visually appealing user interface and includes features like player name input, a game board, and an "About" dialog. Players can enjoy this timeless game while keeping track of their wins and ties.
